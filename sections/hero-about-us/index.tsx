                Indigo Amour is an ethical slow fashion brand from India founded by Seema Singh, an educationist and designer with a background in fashion and textile design. Her journey into sustainable fashion began in 2010, when she started experimenting with natural dyes sourced from Jaipur to create exquisite shibori silk stoles. These handcrafted pieces received a warm response at the Earth Mela at the Italian Embassy in New Delhi, inspiring a deeper commitment to eco-friendly textiles and handloom traditions.
